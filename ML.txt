Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which provides machines the ability to learn automatically and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of machine learning: -
1. Supervised learning:
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we teach the machine using labelled data.
Problem Type: Regression (for continous variable), Classification(for classifying variables into different classes eg. spam and non-spam)
2. Unsupervised Learning:
In unsupervised learning the machine is treained on unlabelled data without any guidance.
Problem Type: Association(discovering patterns in data eg. relation between bread and jam), Clustering(Targeted marketing, cluster customers based on their similarities), anomaly detection(Tracking credit card frauds)
3. Reinforcement Learning:
In reinforcement learning an agent interacts with its enviornment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards.
Training the machine to learn from its mistakes.
Problem Type: Input itself depends upon the actions we take.

Linear Regression (Least Squares): -
y = mx + c
y: dependent variable
x: Independent variable
m: slope
c: constant

Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
Specificity = True Nagatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)

We can use Sensitivity and Specificity to help us decide which machine learning method would be best for our data.
If correctly identifying positives is the most important thing to do with the data, we should choose a method with higher sensitivity.
If correctly identifying negatives is more important, than we should put more emphasis on specificity.

The inablity for a machine learning method(like linear regression) to capture the true relationship is called as bias.

The difference in fits between the training data set and the testing data set is called as a variance.
